# SSCItemplates
A constant work-in-progress package for beautiful RMarkdown templates with USC branding

# Install
To install to your R environment, simply do a devtools install:

`devtools::install_github("kampfsca/SSCItemplates")`

Restart your R environment, then the template should be available with your RMarkdown template options (File->New File->From Template).

# Notes
This was built using MikTex as the LateX compiler, and is currently only built out for the PDFLatex engine (don't try XeLatex). 

If you're using TinyTex as your compiler, good luck.
